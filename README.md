1. The basic requirements of the assignment have been successfully implemented.
I am not completely satisified with the appearance of the website, and
hopefully I can return to it in the future with more CSS experience 
to improve that aspect.

2. I received some help from a TA in regards to using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows
on my Windows laptop. Apart from that I did not collaborate with anyone on the
assignment. 

3. I would say I spent around 6-8 hours on this assignment.
