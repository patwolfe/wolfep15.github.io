<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="mainBody">HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the application layer protocol that is used to serve much of the content on the World Wide Web. Conceived by Tim Berners Lee as he was developing the original Web proposal and maintained by the ITEF, it is one of the core building blocks of the modern Web. In 2017, Mike Bishop proposed HTTP over QUIC, a experimental version of HTTP built on top of the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol that had begun development at Google, in an Internet-Draft (Bishop). In November 2018, the IETF announced officially that HTTP over QUIC would be known as HTTP/3 going forward and that it was being adopted as the next version of the protocol (Mozilla). As of April 2019, HTTP/3 is still being worked on by the QUIC working group and its first full release is planned for later this year. This report sets out to examine the design decisions made in the development in QUIC and HTTP/3, how it improves over the previous versions, and challenges it may face as it is deployed. </p>
<h2>QUIC</h2>
<p class="mainBody">The biggest difference in HTTP/3 compared to previous versions is that it uses QUIC as its transport layer protocol instead of TCP. To understand HTTP/3, it is crucial to first understand the differences between the two transport protocols. </p>
<p class="mainBody">TCP was developed in the 1970s, years before Tim had begun drafting his Web proposal and decades before the idea of Web pages made up of a dozen or more different resources existed (Zakon). As a result, certain aspects of TCP have created issues in the Web that previous versions of HTTP have attempted to work around. QUIC is a transport protocol developed by Google starting in 2012 that implements reliable transfer of bytes via streams, similar to TCP, using UDP with the full knowledge of the modern Web in hand. 
 </p>	
<h3>Protocol Ossification</h3>
<p class="mainBody">An interesting way in which the Web isn't very scalable and the reason for why QUIC is implemented using UDP rather than a wholly new transport protocol is an idea known as "protocol ossification". The idea is that UDP and TCP are so ingrained in the infrastructure that makes up the Web that introducing a new protocol is not feasible. This is because the Web is made up of many routers in addition the computers that act as the endpoints of the system. The firmware of these routers is only capable of handling UDP and TCP, so a new protocol would not be compatible with many of the existing links in the network without updating the firmware of each individual one. This incompatibility would cause increased latency or even inaccessibility, counteracting any benefits the new protocol may introduce. Even making non-insignificant changes to TCP or UDP can cause problems (Corbet). In many ways, the decentralized nature of the Web is what allows it to be so scalable but in this case it has caused the number of protocols that can be used with the Web to be fairly tightly bounded. This is the primary reason why when developing QUIC, Google decided to build on top of UDP rather than create a new transport protocol from the ground up. </p>
<h3>Modularity/Layers</h3>
<p class="mainBody">A layered model is very common in describing the parts of a network stack. Common models include the OSI model and the TCP/IP model. QUIC breaks the idea of a layered model a bit by doing both the transport and the cryptography work itself. Google's implementation of QUIC uses proprietary cryptography while the IETF implementation uses standard TLS 1.3. In a more modular approach, one could just swap out the different security layers while keeping the transport layer the same. However, with QUIC a design decision was made to combine the two largely because it allowed for fewer handshakes (overhead between the client and server in which information is exchanged). With TCP, 3 round trips are needed (3-RTT) to establish a connection. With QUIC, that number is 0-RTT for connections that have been accessed previously (meaning data can start being transmitted immediately) or 1-RTT for new connections (Robin). Part of why the 0-RTT ideal is achievable with QUIC but not TCP is the breaking of modularity. 
<h3>Versioning and extensibility</h3>
<p class="mainBody">As discussed in the Protocol Ossification section of the report, TCP cannot be easily updated in significant ways because of how the current version is ingrained in the Web's infrastructure. QUIC is different because it is implemented on top of UDP. UDP cannot be easily updated for the same reasons as TCP, but QUIC can as it is simply handles and sends UDP packets (and routers and middleboxes already know how to deal with UDP packets). In fact, at the moment QUIC is implemented in the userspace rather than the kernelspace as TCP and UDP are (Iyengar and Thomson). This means QUIC can be easily updated on a machine without touching the kernel code. Updates can even be pushed out to specific applications. For example, QUIC is already available to be enabled on Google's Chrome browser as an advanced setting. This was possible because Google simply pushed an update to Chrome that contained the company's version of QUIC. This is certainly not without trade offs though, being in the userspace has caused QUIC to require more CPU resources than TCP code in the kernelspace that has been optimized for years (Robin). <br>
This ability for QUIC to be updated would be fairly useless if the protocol itself did not take into account the potential for multiple different versions to be attempting to communicate with each other. Luckily, QUIC's designers have planned the protocol with extensibility in mind. Invariant properties of QUIC have already been discussed and established (Thomson). One such property is a version number. The QUIC draft includes a section detailing how two hosts can use QUIC's version negotiation to agree to use a version that both support and move forward using that version(Iyengar and Thomson).
<h3>Multiplexing</h3>
<p class="mainBody">Multiplexing is the ability for a protocol to handle multiple connections or streams at once. One of the primary issues with TCP is TCP head of line blocking. In short, the issue is that in a TCP connection, if a packet is lost in a connection, the progress of the resources being fetched in that connection will block until the packet is recovered via retransmission (Robin). This is because of how packet loss and of of order packets are handled in TCP. Since modern Web pages are often made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources, this can cause major slowdown. For example, the Google Docs page I am using to take notes for this paper is made up of resources fetched with well over a dozen API calls. The benefits of fetching all these resources in parallel is lost if a packet is dropped since all the streams will wait for its recovery. Interestingly, this was not as much of an issue in HTTP/1 since each resource was fetched in order of request, which was the source another problem known as HTTP head of line blocking (discussed below). HTTP/2 added multiplexing so that multiple streams could be managed over a single connection, reintroducing the issue of TCP head of line blocking. QUIC solves this issue by implementing stream multiplexing in the transport layer itself, meaning that application level programs that use it (like HTTP/3) do not need to build their own way of multiplexing that is constrained by the limitations of the transport protocol it is using. A dropped packet in a QUIC connection will only stall the specific stream it was dropped in, allowing the other streams to continue uninterrupted. This is a major reason that QUIC performs better than TCP and is more suitable for the modern Web. </p>
<h3>Connection Naming</h3>
<p class="mainBody">A naming-related difference between QUIC and TCP concerns how connections are named. In TCP, connections are named using a combination of the 2 parties' IP addresses and ports. In QUIC, the name of a connection is a totally opaque UUID (Iyengar and Thomson). This may seem like a minor change, but really shows how QUIC is better suited to the modern Web than TCP. When TCP was created, computers were desktops with wired connections, so a party's IP address changing mid-connection seemed impossible. However, nowadays it's very common for people to switch from a Wi-Fi network to LTE or another Wi-Fi network when they are using their phones. With TCP, they are forced to close their current connections and open new ones when they do so, but with QUIC's opaque connection naming the connection can be maintained even as the user's IP address changes. 
</p>
<h2>HTTP/3</h2>
<p class="mainBody">HTTP/3 is the latest version of HTTP currently being developed by the QUIC Working Group under the purview of the IETF. It is very similar on the surface, with the greatest change being the use of QUIC instead of TCP, as discussed in the previous section. In this section, the flaws of previous HTTP versions will be discussed in addition to benefits of HTTP/3 and its deployment.</p>
<h3>HTTP Head of Line Blocking</h3>
<p class="mainBody">In HTTP/1, multiplexing was not implemented. This means that every resource was fetched via a single stream and because of TCP, that every resource had to be fetched in order. This meant that, for example, the JavaScript component of a Web page could not be loaded before the HTML file for it was completely fetched. To get around this, browsers often opened many TCP connections so that each resource could have an independent stream and be fetched in parallel. This had the downside of requiring many TCP connections to be opened, which requires overhead, maintained at once. A major reason for why HTTP/2 was pushed was that it solved this issue known as HTTP head of line blocking by allowing stream multiplexing, however its solution caused the issue of TCP head of line blocking (discussed above) to come up (Robin). HTTP/3 solves both head of line blocking problems by allowing for multiplexing with independent streams.</p>	
<h3>Alt-Svc</h3>
<p class="mainBody">'Alt-Svc' is an HTTP response header field that allows a origin to announce which other locations its resources are available at and which protocols can be used to access them. This is done via a triple with the following format: <code>([application level protocol id], [host], [port #]).</code> There is a naming aspect to this, as for a protocol to provided in the triple it must have an agreed-upon (meaning IETF approved) id. For HTTP/2 this is "h2" and for HTTP/3 it's "h3" (Nottingham). This allows for resources to be available through multiple protocols and for applications (such as the browser) to decide when to use an alternate one. In the deployment of HTTP/3, this means browsers can have a way to fall back to HTTP/2 if they encounter issues using HTTP/3 for a resource. Reasons why issues could come up are discussed in the "Obstacles" section.
</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
 <h4>Forced Security</h4>
 <p class="mainBody">HTTP/2 is compatible with HTTP connections in addition to HTTPS, while HTTP/3 is only compatible with HTTPS as QUIC will always encrypt data it sends. The added flexibility of HTTP/2 could be seen as an advantage, but encryption helps protect users' privacy and having it as mandatory rather than as an opt-in makes HTTP/3 preferable as it ensures the safety of general users who may not know the difference.</p>
 <h4>Lossy Networks</h4>
<p class="mainBody">HTTP/3's biggest area of improvement performance wise is with regards to packet loss. Both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 incur some kind of head of line blocking when a packet is lost while multiple resources are being fetched. With HTTP/3 this blocking will not occur, so there is less latency in the event of a packet being dropped. This means that the greatest performance increase will be seen in networks which are especially lossy. Ideally, the use of HTTP/3 will make the Internet more accessible to people whose networks are currently too poor to use it effectively, making the Web better for everyone as more contributors increases its value as a whole (Metcalfe's Law). According to Google, when they deployed QUIC in their internal load balancers, they saw load times for pages improve "8% globally, and up to 13% in regions where latency is higher" (Behr and Swett).</p>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>
<p class="mainBody">The concept of protocol ossification discussed earlier still applies to an extent to QUIC's deployment. Many routers are not nearly as optimized for UDP transfers as for TCP transfers simply because in the past TCP was far more popular. Additionally, some routers restrict which ports can be used for UDP transfers as it has been used for attacks in the past (HTTP/3 Explained). This presents a challenge in the deployment of HTTP/3, as it will need to grow in popularity for incentive to update routers to exist, but it will not be able to grow in popularity unless it is faster than alternatives. Fortunately, companies like Google and Facebook have incentive to update their infrastructure to work well with HTTP/3 as faster connections (both internal within their company services and external to consumers) means saving and making more money for them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="mainBody">HTTP/3 will likely be officially released in the next year. For the reasons discussed in this paper, I believe it will eventually rise to be the dominant protocol used in the Web. QUIC has superior support for parallel fetching of resources, built in security, lower connection establishment overhead (0-RTT), and can be extended far more easily than TCP. In particular, the last one stands out to me as being a chief reason why HTTP/3 will be successful. We don't know exactly what the future holds for the Web. QUIC both implements a secure and high performance transport protocol for the modern Web and leaves the option for it to be easily extended or updated in the future. It is impressive TCP has managed to remain effective for as long as it has, but QUIC presents a stronger alternative. Despite the obstacles introducing a new protocol into a system in which TCP is heavily embedded presents, with the backing of big tech companies I think QUIC will eventually become prominent as TCP is. I am excited to see what the future holds for the QUIC protocol and how HTTP/3 will be received in the next few years as it becomes more widely used.</p>
